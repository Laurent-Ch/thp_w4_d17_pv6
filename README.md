This project is a turned-based, text-based fighting mini-game whose purpose is to **discover OOP concepts**.

The first version —*app.rb*— is basic: two NPCs fight.
The second one –*app_2.rb*— is more complex : one PC fights 2 NPCs, and two new game mechanics are introduced : weapons classes and health packs. 
The third and final version —*app_3.rb*— makes the PC fight 4 NPCs, and all the necessary methods are stored in the Game class file (except for a little one at the top that makes the whole process a bit more more readable by adding some breaks where the user has to press a key for the game to go on to the next phase).
